#### Question/Need
* Small businesses are at a severe disadvantage in leveraging data analytics. 
* The cost/benefit of sophisticated data acquisition and analysis make it a difficult proposition for a single small business.
* However, in a dense urban environment like NYC, a neighborhood small business association or coop can pool resources to hire a data analytics and marketing firm to essentially function as its marketing arm thus gaining many of the advantages available to their large competitors.

#### Benefits/Deliverables
* Spread cost of data acquisition and analysis over many businesses
* Build the capability to conduct hyper targeted advertising based on time of day and demographic changes in the neighborhood throughout the day.
* Advertising would be delivered via social media on mobile devices.
* Use MTA data to identify opportunities for targeted advertising outside the usual rush-hour or lunch period time slots when advertising rates may be substantially lower  
* Identify opportunities for using MTA data as a preliminary filter for the association to purchase geo-location data for targeted advertising at the individual level
* Begin process of building a “community” customer database that can be leveraged for future marketing initiatives like cross promotions between various businesses targeted based on time of day, demographics, and individual data.

#### Data Description
* Use the MTA turnstile data to show what is possible in terms of targeting advertising by time of day
* Focus on the canal street station to demonstrate hyper local trends
* Try to obtain Manhattan demographic data by time of day
* Show samples of geo-location data available for purchase and how that might be used in the future
* The individual unit would be a station since the targeted clients would be small businesses within a five-block distance of a subway station
* If demographic data by time of day is available, the end goal would be to build highly targeted advertising campaigns based on time of day and the demos for that time of day.

#### Tools
* SQlite
* Python/Pandas
* Matplotlib or Seaborne
* Identify additional tools as project progresses

#### MVP Goal
A visualization of area population changes throughout the day and ideas for targeted advertising. It would be really great if time of day demographic data is available along with the MTA data.
